- Simple probability
- A.K.A. belief network/casual networks
- Function off directed a-cyclic graphs

## Conditional Probability
- Joint probability is measure of two events at once
- P(A and B) is the intersection of a and b
  - i.e. $P(A \cap B)$
- Conditional Probability of b is probability that the event B will occur given that A has already occured
- $P(B|A)$
  - probability of B given that A occurs
  - if A and B are dependant:
    - $P(B|A) = P(A \cup B) / P(A)$
