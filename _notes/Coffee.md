---



> 20/04/2023 A coffee professional gave a rundown at the Wembley hotel.

Hotter temps mean grind gets smaller (as machine warms)
30 sec pull becomes
32 etc
Only if very busy

### Milk
Heat / stretch / spin ->

Temp / combine / foam
55-65 deg
For hot 65-75deg
Steam to side facing wall gives spin
Scream means needs stretch
6-7 of tsxh tsxh noise for cappucino
Standing still as to not disrupt spin
Pad of thumb to measure temp because temp stable

- Good consistent measure

Wipe back to down wipe purge

Steamed milk sugars break down

- Lactose and glucose

Fresh cold milk each time

Bottom of milk spout is max per froth

Water first for l.b.

Long mac topped = double latte unless dif lvl topped
Melbourne mac 2 shot top up up hot water

Albeit I worked near an Italian restaurant after having this info sesh and was told something completely different. Seems Aussies like to make things up. The trainer allegedly did these sessions WA wide. Specifically that last point.
