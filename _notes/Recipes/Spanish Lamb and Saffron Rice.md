## Ingredients
- **1 Frenched Rack of Lamb/Leg steaks**
  -	1 Tbsp Spanish Spice Blend
  -	E.g. Smoked Paprika, Ground Cumin, Ground Coriander, Dried Mexican Oregano, Cayenne Pepper & Ground Cinnamon
 > I used lemon pepper steak rub, any cumin/paprika spice mix is good
- **Saffron Rice**
  - 2 cup rice
  -	1 decent pinch Saffron
  -	Quarter cube of chicken stock/a pinch of salt
- **Veggies**
  -	Garlic/Chilli Paste
  -	1 Red, Yellow, or Orange Bell Pepper 
  -	1 Shallot 
  -	3 oz Shishito Peppers (or any chilli)
  -	1 oz Castelvetrano Olives (optional)
  -	1 Tbsp Sherry Vinegar (to deglaze)
- **Garnish**
  -	1 bunch Parsley/Coriander
  -	2 Tbsps Sliced Roasted Almonds (optional)
  -	Fresh Lemon Juice

## Method
### Roast the lamb
-	Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, preheat to 450°F.
-	Line a sheet pan with foil
-	Pat the lamb dry with paper towels; season on all sides with salt, pepper, and enough of the spice blend to coat (you may have extra). Place on the sheet pan, bone side down
-	Roast 27 to 29 minutes for medium (125°F), or until cooked to your desired degree of doneness.*
-	Transfer to a cutting board and let rest at least 10 minutes
-	ALTERNATIVELY JUST COOK LAMB STEAKS LIKE NORMAL STEAK
### Cook & finish the rice
-	Once the lamb has roasted about 10 minutes, in a small pot, combine the rice, saffron, a big pinch of salt, and 1 cup of water. Heat to boiling on high
-	Once boiling, reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook, without stirring, 13 to 15 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender
-	Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork; stir in the raisins. Cover to keep warm
### Prepare the vegetables
-	Meanwhile, wash and dry the fresh produce
-	Peel and thinly slice the shallot
-	Cut off and discard the stem of the bell pepper. Halve lengthwise; remove the ribs and seeds, then large dice
-	Pit and roughly chop the olives
-	Roughly chop the parsley leaves and stems
-	Cut off and discard the stems of the shishito peppers; halve lengthwise. Thoroughly wash your hands, knife, and cutting board immediately after handling
### Cook the vegetables
-	While the lamb rests, in a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot
-	Fry off garlic/chilli for 30sec/till fragrant
-	Add the sliced shallot, diced bell pepper, and halved shishito peppers; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned and softened
-	Add the vinegar (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the liquid has cooked off
-	Turn off the heat; stir in the chopped olives. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired
