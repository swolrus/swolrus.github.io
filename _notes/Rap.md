I'm on a switch play
Citizen walk it's a mental state
Free my thoughts keep a clean brain
Level up yuh you're a wet stain

They want more than a quick sham
all that's giving is the ick man
Finding flags like Mario
think they're peach but they're Wario

hand on a switch blade
it's not me but I feel safe
Cutting deals not sorry though
life's peachy, you're just slow
